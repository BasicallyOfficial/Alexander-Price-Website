      <h1 style="text-align:center;"> Wine Glass 3D Model</h1>
      <p style="text-align:center;" >This project is one of my 3D models that I have made in Blender. I have a few 3D models now, but this was one of the first that I had made. This includes the staging, textures, modeling, lighting, coloring, etc. This wine glass on a table with a tablecloth is a simple piece, but i believe it was a project that tested me in a lot of different areas in the process of using Blender, and I think is a good starting point for moving on towards more advanced work in 3D.</p>
