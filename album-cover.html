      <h1 style="text-align:center;"> Album Covers</h1>
      <p style="text-align:center;" >This project was my venture into making album covers for some of my favorite albums. The first album is Flying by Wire by Trocadero, and is a cropped portion of a stock photo from Pexels.com. I took the photo, changed the color balance/hue/saturation, and added some noise along with some info text at the bottom. The second cover for Casiopea's Mint Jams album is a picture that I took of the SJSU campus at sunset. I changed the saturation and hue a little bit as well as adding a mint green border to spice it up for the cover. The last picture is another stock photo from Pexels that I used for The Very Best of Hall and Oates Album, which is a collection of their greatest hits. I cropped out a part of a landscape, rebalanced the colors, applied a few filters, and denoised the photo before adding in a picture of Hall and Oates from an old interview in the background at 45% opacity and a cyan filter. Each of these albums are very different in musical style, and I aimed to reflect that in the covers, which I believe went pretty well. </p>
